This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify cybersecurity incidents into True Positive (TP), Benign Positive (BP), or False Positive (FP) using the GUIDE dataset. The model enhances the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by automating the triage process, improving threat detection accuracy, and enabling guided response systems for faster threat mitigation. Evaluated using Macro-F1 Score, Precision, and Recall, the solution is designed for real-world applications to support SOCs, automate incident response, and strengthen enterprise security. To get started, clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the training script. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
